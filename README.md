# GMS2 Animation


<!-- OVERVIEW -->
This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introduction to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> using their scrpting language <i>GML</i>. This assumes no prior knowledge of the software or scripting. 

This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introducton to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> using their sprite and tiling tools. It is a good idea to look at [Sprite Editor IDE Basics](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/4370/the-sprite-editor-ide-basics) but this walk through will be a bit more hands on.

This walkthrough also assumes you have access to Photoshop (or another pixel basee editor) though there are other free options out there for pixel editing.
		
This is a just a primer on game animation and not a detailed guide.  It is just to get you up and running in developing raster based 2-d animation assets.  We will end with creating controls for a playable sprite. 

* Tested on GameMake Studio2.3.5.589
* [GitHub Account](https://github.com) (free)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

In this walk through:

* Review of 2-D Ball Bounce
* Ball Bounce in Game. Get the ball bounce to match the video.
* Horizontal Movement.  Have the ball move from left to right.
* Squash and Stretch.  Make the ball squish when hitting the ground and stretch on the bounce.
* Animating a Run Cycle
* Importing Animations
* Player movement with keyboard and gamepad
